Custom ComfyUI nodes for interactive image manipulation and flexible file looping. Provides four specialized nodes for cropping, pasting, looping, and saving various file types with preview capabilities.

ComfyUI-Loop is essentially a pair of nodes designed to create a simple file loop within your workflows. The operating principle is straightforward: the Save Any node saves an image by overwriting the file specified in the 'path' field, making it automatically available for the next iteration. This functionality is primarily intended for inpainting workflows.

# 0.2 version - last changes 10/23/2025 :
Better integration with last ComfyUI version. Better code structure.
- Now there's only four nodes for two main usages, looping files and visual cutting-pasting: 
  LoopAny -> SaveAny
  loop any file type : image (png), mask (png), latent (image/audio/whatever), audio (flac), string (or int/float) saved as text file.

  ImageCrop -> ImagePaste
  ImageCrop now works with last Comfy frontend, lastly tested with ComfyUI v0.3.64, ComfyUI_Frontend v1.27.10

TL;DR : Revisited code from A to Z. Crop your images and masks, loop your files, the fun way.

## ♾️ Image Crop (`ImageCropLoop`)
**Functionality:** Interactive image cropping with live preview. Supports some keyboard controls (PageUp/Down to resize).

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `image` | - | Source image to crop |
| `x` | 0-32768 | X-origin of crop rectangle |
| `y` | 0-32768 | Y-origin of crop rectangle |
| `size` | 256-2048 | Crop size (increments of 8) |
| `color` | ["black","grey","red","green","blue"] | unselected preview color |
| `show_mask` | boolean | show binary mask preview |
| `mask` | Optional mask |

**Outputs:**
- `source`: Original image
- `cut`: Cropped image
- `size`: Final crop size used
- `x`: Final X-position used
- `y`: Final Y-position used
- `cut_mask`: Cropped mask

---

## ♾️ Paste Image (`ImagePasteLoop`)
**Functionality:** Pastes cropped images onto source images with optional masking/blending.

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `source` | Base image to paste onto |
| `cut` | Image segment to paste |
| `x` | X-position for pasting |
| `y` | Y-position for pasting |
| `cut_mask` | Optional mask for blending |

**Outputs:**
- `image`: final image

---

## ♾️ Loop Any (`LoopAny`)
**Functionality:** Loops various file types (images, masks, latents, audio, text) from ComfyUI's output directory or one of its subfolders

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `input` | ANY | - | Input data to process/loop |
| `loop_file` | BOOL | False | Enable file looping mode |
| `filename` | STRING | "loop_file" | Base filename (no extension) |
| `subfolder` | STRING | "" | Output subdirectory |
| `loop_mask` | BOOL | False | Enable mask looping ( load mask from loop image alpha channel instead of mask input|
| `mask` | MASK | - | Optional input mask |

**Outputs:**
- `output`: Processed output data
- `path`: Full file path
- `width`: Output width (images)
- `height`: Output height (images)
- `mask`: optional mask to send to Save Any node, for saving as alpha channel

---

## ♾️ Save Any (`SaveAny`)
**Functionality:** Saves various data types to output directory with optional versioned backups and optional preview.

**Inputs:**
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `input` | ANY | - | Data to save |
| `path` | STRING | "/path/to/file.ext" | Full output path |
| `save_steps` | BOOL | False | Save timestamped copies |
| `mask` | MASK | - | Optional mask (for images) |

**SAaing Output Formats:**
- Images: `.png`
- Masks: `.png`
- Latents: `.latent`
- Audio: `.flac`
- Text: `.txt`

**Install**
No additional dependencies are required. Search for 'Loop' in the ComfyUI Custom Nodes Manager or copy the ComfyUI-Loop folder into the Custom Nodes directory — and you're ready to go!

**Usage**
Have a look at the example workflow (json or .png), for up to date informations on usage and a working example.
- in  Load Image (LOOP) node browse for an image from **output folder** (or feed the field with its name e.g. 'image.png'). **Always** work on a copy of your source file (if you don't want it to be overwritten).
- Connect the path output from Load Image (LOOP) to the image_path input of Save Image (LOOP).
- The mask input in Save Image (LOOP) is optional.
- Enable save steps if you want to keep a copy of the file at each iteration.

**Limitations**
- No support for lists or batch inputs.
- Not as user friendly as I want it to be out of the box (some small lacks in code to fix later.)

**Future plans**
- adding some sort of mask edit bridge in the Loop crop node
- more file format outputs
- better code

I plan to revisit the code later but it works well for basic use (don't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, I do my best :D). 
If you encounter issues or have suggestions, ask on the repo ! :)
